# Fault-Tolerant Quantum Key Distribution
`project.ipynb` contains an implementation of the E91 quantum key distribution
algorithm as well as the Steane quantum error correcting code.

The code is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) notebook, and requires [PyQuil
2.8.0](https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start.html), 
 [Grove 1.7.0](https://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html),
 and [Forest Benchmarking
 0.4.0](https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking) and their dependencies.

 Executing the notebook will run the benchmarks in the paper.
